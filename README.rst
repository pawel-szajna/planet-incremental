This is the source code repository for a space-themed incremental game, which is currently called "planet incremental". The game itself is written in C++, and can be built for numerous targets, the main one being web browser (as this is where majority of players seem to be playing idle/incremental games), though the target platform is not set in stone.

The source code of this game is released under the `MIT license <LICENSE>`_.
